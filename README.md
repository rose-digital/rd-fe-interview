## Oh hai!

You're here for an interview aren't you...ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Set up your screen so you can see the editor on one side and the localhost page in Chrome on the other side
5. Listen for instructions on what to build and code away
6. When your interview is over (and if requested), zip your directory and send it to your interviewer for later review  

Good luck!
